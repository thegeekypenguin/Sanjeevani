### Project made under AVISHKAR 2k21 :trophy: :1st_place_medal:

## Idea:
  We thought of making a website which will allow **doctors, patients and hospitals to login / signup**. Patient should be able to **take appointments, upload reports, make voice, video calls**
  to the doctor (after appointment). 
  *Doctors can keep secret notes for patients*, can **update patient's condition**.
  Patients can see their **nearby hospitals, labs, clinics**, etc. and then take appointments.
  
## Tech Stacks
  1. Used React and tailwind for frontend.
  1. Used Node & express in the backend, MongoDb for the database.
  1. Used Mapbox for creating maps, nodemailer for sending mails, mongoose for modelling data, jsonwebtoken, cookie-parser for handling cookies, bcrypt for hashing password, nodemon as development dependency for running backend server.
 
 The site is live at: https://sanjeevani-avishkar-2k21.netlify.app/ 
  
 ## Thankyou :pray:
